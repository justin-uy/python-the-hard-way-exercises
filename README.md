# python-the-hard-way-exercises

All of the exercises (this will force me to do all of the exercises) from the book: http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ The goal is to learn all the basics of Python without skipping over anything, which might typically happen when an experience programmer learns a new language.

Note: Some of these exercises were done with my own embellishments for my own entertainment and to suppress some of the boredom. Additionally, as an additional exercise, all of the code will be written using vim.

After further reviewing the contents of the book, I changed my mind. One can only do so many lessons that introduce an if statement.

Going forward, I will just commit various code exercises that I give myself to better understand the language.
Exercise 0: Write a script to rename all file names where the exercise number does not have a leading 0 if it 9 or below.
Exercise 1: Write a terminal based game of blackjack against a computer (WIP)
