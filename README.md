# python-the-hard-way-exercises

All of the exercises (this will force me to do all of the exercises) from the book: http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ The goal is to learn all the basics of Python without skipping over anything, which might typically happen when an experience programmer learns a new language.

Note: Some of these exercises were done with my own embellishments for my own entertainment and to suppress some of the boredom. Additionally, as an additional exercise, all of the code will be written using vim.
